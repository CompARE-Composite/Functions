# Functions

## Description

This repository contains the R functions for the shiny-app CompARE (https://www.grbio.eu/compare/). CompARE is a web-platform inspired to provide help on issues relating to trials with composite endpoints.

## Contents

- _**Functions_Binary**_ contains the functions referred to Binary composite endpoints.
- _**Functions_T2E**_ contains the functions referred to Time to Event composite endpoints.
- _**BCG_CaseStudies**_ contains the code to reproduce the figures and tables showed in the app based on parametres from real studies.
